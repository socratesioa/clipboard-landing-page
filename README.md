## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a very nice design file. The challenge was interesting. I didn't encounter many new things. But it was really good practice in CSS Grid and Flexbox. There were a lot of opportunities to test my knowledge.

### Continued development

As challenges get larger, it's even more important to maintain clean code. I find that with every challenge I become better at this.
